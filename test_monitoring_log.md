## Test Execution Log

### Phase 1: Authentication Flow Tests (COMPLETED)
**Results:** 11 passed / 3 failed (79% pass rate)
**Backend Errors Identified:**
- Missing auth endpoints: `/auth/providers` (404), `/api/auth/permissions` (401), `/auth/login` (404)
- Authentication failures: Multiple 401 Unauthorized responses
- Static file serving working correctly: `/static/css/output.css` and `/static/js/navigation.js` returning 200

### Phase 2: Requirements Management Tests (COMPLETED)
**Results:** 18 passed / 22 failed (45% pass rate)
**Backend API Endpoints Missing:**
- `/projects/1/requirements` (404) - Requirements list endpoint
- `/projects/1/requirements/new` (404) - New requirement form endpoint
**Test Pattern:** All advanced requirements tests failed due to login issues (all failed at authentication step, stayed on login page instead of reaching dashboard)
**Root Cause:** Authentication system not working - tests can't login so they fail at `expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*\/dashboard/)`
**CRUD Tests Success:** Basic form validation and UI component tests passed (18/40)

### Phase 3: AI Assistant and Integration Tests (COMPLETED)
**Results:** 0 passed / 43 failed (0% pass rate)
**Test Pattern:** All tests failed at authentication - can't reach dashboard to test AI features
**Root Cause:** Same authentication blocker preventing all feature testing

### Phase 4: User Management and RBAC Tests (COMPLETED)
**Results:** 0 passed / 24 failed (0% pass rate)
**Test Pattern:** All tests failed at authentication - can't reach dashboard to test user management
**Root Cause:** Same authentication blocker preventing all feature testing

### Phase 5: Tenant Management Tests (COMPLETED)
**Results:** 0 passed / 24 failed (0% pass rate)
**Test Pattern:** All tests failed at authentication - can't reach dashboard to test tenant management
**Root Cause:** Same authentication blocker preventing all feature testing

## Comprehensive Testing Summary

**Total Tests Run:** 131 tests across 5 phases
**Overall Results:** 29 passed / 102 failed (22% pass rate)

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Authentication System Complete Failure (CRITICAL)
- **Missing Endpoints:**
  - `/auth/providers` (404) - Auth provider configuration
  - `/auth/login` (404) - Login processing endpoint
  - `/api/auth/permissions` (401) - User permissions check
- **Impact:** Blocks all application functionality beyond login page
- **Affected Features:** All dashboard features, all user workflows
- **Priority:** P0 - System blocker

#### 2. Requirements Management API Missing (HIGH)
- **Missing Endpoints:**
  - `/projects/1/requirements` (404) - Requirements list
  - `/projects/1/requirements/new` (404) - New requirement form
- **Impact:** Core application functionality not accessible
- **Priority:** P1 - Feature blocker

#### 3. Dashboard Navigation Blocked (HIGH)
- **Issue:** All feature tests fail at `expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*\/dashboard/)`
- **Impact:** Complete application workflow blocked
- **Priority:** P1 - User workflow blocker

### Working Components
- Static file serving: `/static/css/output.css` and `/static/js/navigation.js` (200)
- Basic UI form validation and components (18 tests passed)
- Frontend form interactions and basic navigation

### Error Pattern Analysis
- **Backend Pattern:** Consistent 404/401 errors for authentication and API endpoints
- **Frontend Pattern:** HTMX loading and navigation working, but blocked by missing backend
- **Integration Pattern:** Authentication dependency blocking all downstream feature testing
