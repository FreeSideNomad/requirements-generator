# Requirements Gathering Application - Vision

## Product Vision
A multi-tenant SaaS requirements gathering platform that uses AI to guide teams through creating comprehensive product requirements using domain-driven design principles. The platform leverages OpenAI's API with real-time Server-Sent Events to provide interactive, industry-specific guidance for developing product visions, identifying bounded contexts, and creating structured requirements from epics down to user stories. The primary output is human-readable markdown documentation that serves as living documentation, with the platform supporting multiple industries through configurable business context templates.
