# Enterprise-Friendly Real-Time Communication Alternatives

## Problem Statement

WebSockets are often blocked or restricted in enterprise banking environments due to:
- Corporate firewall policies
- Proxy server configurations that don't support WebSocket upgrades
- Security policies requiring HTTP-only traffic
- Network monitoring tools that don't inspect WebSocket traffic
- Legacy infrastructure compatibility issues

## Solution: Progressive Enhancement Strategy

### Tier 1: Server-Sent Events (SSE) - Primary Method

**Advantages for Banking Environments:**
- Uses standard HTTP connections
- Works through most corporate firewalls and proxies
- Unidirectional from server to client (simpler security model)
- Built-in reconnection handling
- No special infrastructure requirements

**Implementation:**
```yaml
SSE_Configuration:
  endpoint: GET /api/sessions/{sessionId}/events
  headers:
    Accept: "text/event-stream"
    Cache-Control: "no-cache"
    Connection: "keep-alive"

  event_types:
    - message_added
    - participant_joined
    - participant_left
    - ai_response_ready
    - session_status_changed
    - typing_indicator (optional)

  reconnection:
    auto_retry: true
    retry_interval: 5_seconds
    max_retries: 10
    exponential_backoff: true

  heartbeat:
    interval: 30_seconds
    event_type: "heartbeat"
    data: {timestamp: DateTime}
```

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Supported in all modern browsers
- Graceful degradation to long polling if SSE fails
- Works through corporate proxies that support HTTP/1.1

### Tier 2: Long Polling - Fallback Method

**Use Case:** When SSE is blocked but HTTP keep-alive works

**Implementation:**
```yaml
Long_Polling_Configuration:
  endpoint: GET /api/sessions/{sessionId}/updates
  timeout: 30_seconds
  retry_delay: 2_seconds

  request_parameters:
    lastEventId: UUID (client's last received event)
    eventTypes: List[EventType] (filter events)
    timeout: Int (max wait time in seconds)

  response_handling:
    immediate_response: "If events available"
    timeout_response: "Empty response after timeout"
    error_handling: "Exponential backoff on errors"

  client_behavior:
    immediate_reconnect: "On successful response with data"
    delayed_reconnect: "On timeout or error"
    max_concurrent_requests: 1 (per session)
```

**Enterprise Benefits:**
- Uses standard HTTP GET requests
- No persistent connections required
- Works with all proxy configurations
- Can be cached and monitored by enterprise tools

### Tier 3: Short Polling - Enterprise Fallback

**Use Case:** Highly restricted environments where long connections are not allowed

**Implementation:**
```yaml
Short_Polling_Configuration:
  endpoint: GET /api/sessions/{sessionId}/updates
  interval: 5_seconds (configurable: 3-10 seconds)

  request_parameters:
    since: DateTime (last update timestamp)
    includeTyping: false (disabled for performance)
    batchSize: 50 (max events per request)

  optimization:
    conditional_requests: "If-Modified-Since headers"
    etag_support: "ETags for cache validation"
    compression: "gzip compression enabled"
    batching: "Multiple updates in single response"

  bandwidth_optimization:
    delta_updates: "Only send changes since last request"
    event_prioritization: "Critical events first"
    adaptive_polling: "Increase interval during inactivity"
```

**Enterprise Network Friendly:**
- Standard HTTP requests only
- No persistent connections
- Predictable network traffic patterns
- Full compatibility with all proxy types
