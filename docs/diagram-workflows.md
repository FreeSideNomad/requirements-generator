# Documentation Generation and Optional Visual Supplements

## Primary Focus: Markdown Documentation

The application's primary output is comprehensive, human-readable markdown documentation. Visual artifacts are secondary and only generated when specifically requested or when they significantly enhance understanding of complex relationships.

## Markdown Documentation Templates

### 1. Bounded Context Documentation Template
**Purpose**: Comprehensive textual description of bounded contexts and their relationships
**Format**: Structured markdown with tables and cross-references
**Auto-generation triggers**:
- New bounded context created
- Context relationship modified
- Integration pattern identified

**Template Structure**:
```markdown
# [Context Name] Bounded Context

## Overview
[Brief description of the context's purpose and responsibilities]

## Domain Objects
| Object Name | Type | Description | Key Attributes |

### 2. Domain Object Documentation Template
**Purpose**: Detailed textual specifications of domain objects and their relationships
**Format**: Structured markdown with attribute tables and behavior descriptions

### 3. Process Flow Documentation Template
**Purpose**: Detailed textual descriptions of user interactions and business processes
**Format**: Step-by-step markdown with decision points and alternative flows

#### AI Prompts for Diagram Updates

##### Context Map Updates
```
Prompt Template:
"Based on the following changes to bounded contexts and their relationships:
{context_changes}

Current context map shows:
{current_diagram_description}

Please suggest updates to the context map diagram that:
1. Reflect the new/modified bounded contexts
2. Show updated relationships and integration patterns
3. Highlight any new anti-corruption layers needed
4. Maintain visual clarity and proper grouping

Provide the updated Mermaid diagram code and explain the changes made."
```

##### Domain Relationship Updates
```
Prompt Template:
"The domain model has been updated with the following changes:
{domain_changes}

Current domain relationship diagram includes:
{current_entities_and_relationships}

Generate an updated entity relationship diagram that:
1. Includes new domain objects and their attributes
2. Shows updated relationships (1:1, 1:many, many:many)
3. Identifies aggregate roots and boundaries
4. Maintains proper normalization and clarity

Provide the updated Mermaid ERD code and highlight what changed."
```

##### User Journey Updates
